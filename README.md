## Setup

### Dependencies

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Secrets

Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add any necessary environment variables (i.e. bot token, api key, firebase credentials, database url).

### Deploy

python bot.py
```

Or configure the repo to some third party hosting service such as Heroku.
